        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Poe asks why science preys on the poet. Science is peering, destructive and interested<br>
           only in cold realities. It will not allow the poet to soar in fantasy or even to sit<br>
           peacefully dreaming beneath a tree.[1]</p>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>"Sonnet - To Science" is a poet's lament over the dangers of scientific development<br>
          and its negative implications for poetry and creativity. Poe lived and wrote in the<br>
          early nineteenth century as the European Industrial Revolution was crossing the Atlantic<br>
          and transforming the technological landscape of the eastern United States, and his poem<br>
          reflects an artistic backlash to the potential problems of the emerging America. Poe's<br>
          concerns have been relevant at every stage of scientific progress, from the Renaissance<br>
          to the current day, as each series of technological changes awakens the eternal fear that<br>
          man will destroy his own humanity during his excited search for better machinery.</p>

        <p>In particular, "Sonnet - To Science" hints at the tension between the forward-looking<br>
          advances of the Industrial Revolution and the nature-oriented tendencies of the Romantic<br>
          era. Romanticism had appeared as a counterargument to the Enlightenment philosophy of<br>
          embracing and celebrating progress. Members of this movement sought to return to a purer,<br>
          more innocent state of nature because they felt that society had corrupted man's innate<br>
          goodness. Poe was a member of the American Romantic movement, and the poet of Poe's<br>
          sonnet accordingly explores the inevitable clash between the Romantic outlook on life<br>
          and the comparative thoughtlessness of industrialism.</p>

        <p>The poet of Poe's sonnet worries about and rejects scientific dogmatism because he regards<br>
          it as too unimaginative and stagnating. For him, science is a predator or, like a vulture,<br>
          a carrion-eater, and it has damagingly crippled his imagination with "dull realities."<br>
          In his apostrophe to science, he alludes to characters from Greek and Roman mythology,<br>
          such as the Hamadryad and Naiad nymphs and Diana, the Roman goddess of the hunt,<br>
          describing their forced banishment as evidence that humanity is too willing to discard<br>
          its creative soul.To reinforce the value of the past over the value of the thoughtless<br>
          future, Poe uses a traditional English sonnet form to arrange his thoughts. A sonnet<br>
          consists of fourteen lines, which in the Shakespearean form can be divided into three<br>
          heroic quatrains and one heroic couplet, where the overall rhyme scheme is ABAB CDCD<br>
          EFEF GG. The lines are heroic because they use iambic pentameter, or a series of five<br>
          iambs, where each iamb is an unstressed followed by a stressed syllable. The sonnet form<br>
          has existed for centuries, and when combined with the archaic diction, the narrator tries<br>
          to show the beauty of old forms as a structural contrast to the ugliness of scientific realities.</p>

        <p>Despite the apparent message of the sonnet, some details of "To Science" could serve to<br>
          undermine the poet's words. He ironically personifies science in the first line, which may<br>
          suggest that he unconsciously recognizes some humanity even in what he perceives as the<br>
          stultifying influence of science. On the other hand, his personification may highlight his<br>
          fundamental incompatibility with science, since he cannot help but poeticize the mundane.<br>
          In addition, the use of a rigid sonnet form may also indicate that poetry is itself not as<br>
          free-formed as the poet characterizes it to be, or alternatively it may suggest that some<br>
          constraints do not necessarily indicate the strangulation of the imagination.<a href="#citation-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
